He acknowledges his past mistakes, particularly his interference in her sister’s happiness, and explains that his actions were driven by concern rather than arrogance. Elizabeth, having reassessed Darcy’s character and witnessed his quiet acts of kindness and personal growth, recognizes that her own prejudice had blinded her to his true nature. Their mutual confessions reflect emotional maturity on both sides, as pride gives way to understanding and prejudice is replaced by respect, ultimately uniting them in a relationship founded on honesty, equality, and genuine affection.\n",
