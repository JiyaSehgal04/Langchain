      "A closed-ended question is any question for which a researcher provides research participants with options from which to choose a response. Closed-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a statement that requires a response.\n",
      "A closed-ended question contrasts with an open-ended question, which cannot easily be answered with specific information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Examples ==\n",
      "Examples of closed-ended questions that may elicit a \"yes\" or \"no\" response include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Were you born in 2010?\n",
      "Is Lyon the capital of France?\n",
      "Did you steal the money?\n",
      "Similarly, variants of the above closed-ended questions that possess specific responses are:\n",
      "\n",
      "On what day were you born? (\"Saturday.\")\n",
      "What is the capital of France? (\"Paris.\")\n",
      "Where did you steal the money from? (\"The bank.\")\n",
      "At the same time, there are closed-ended questions that are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: \"Have you stopped taking heroin?\" (if you never took it) or \"Who told you to take heroin?\"; see \"loaded question\" and \"\"leading question\".\n",
      "A study by the University of Cincinnati found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of social pressure, using context clues to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional Metallic Metals Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Alternative formulations ==\n",
      "There are alternative names for the same concept. There is an entry in \"A Dictionary of Psychology – Oxford Reference\" for \"closed question\" for the concept described here. Statistics for search queries show \"closed question\" is coming more often than \"close ended question\" and \"closed-ended question\". Statistics from \"ngram\" show \"closed question\" is twice more frequent than \"closed-ended question\" in books.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== In education ==\n",
      "Some in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking \"bad\" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.\n",
      "Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley's central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are \"grammatically closed, but conceptually open\". For example, in standard parlance, \"Is it ever right to lie?\" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be \"opened up\" by the questioner (\"Why do you think that?\", \"Could there be an instance where that's not the case?\"), inviting elaboration and enquiry.\n",
      "This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, \"gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question\". Closed questions, simply require \"opening up\" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.\n",
      "Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention \"Open Questioning Mindset\" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of students' contributions and look for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that \n",

      "\"What Is a Nation?\" (French: Qu'est-ce qu'une nation ?) is an 1882 lecture by French historian Ernest Renan (1823–1892) at the Sorbonne, known for the statements that a nation is \"a daily plebiscite\", and that nations are based as much on what people jointly forget as on what they remember.  It is frequently quoted or anthologized in works of history or political science pertaining to nationalism and national identity. It exemplifies   a contractualist understanding of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Nationhood in Renan's time ==\n",
      "Renan begins his essay by noting that there is frequent confusion between the idea of nationhood and of racial or linguistic groupings, a form of confusion which he says can produce \"the gravest errors\". He promises to conduct an autopsy-like examination, \"in an absolutely cold and impartial fashion.\"\n",
      "He claims that nations existing at the time of writing in 1882, such as France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Russia, will continue to exist for hundreds of years, and that any nation trying to dominate them will be quickly pushed back to its own borders,  by a coalition of other nations; \"The establishment of a new Roman or Charlemagnian Empire has become an impossibility.\"\n",
      "Renan believes that nations developed from the common needs of the people, who consisted of different social groups seeking a \"collective identity\". He praises the eighteenth century for its achievements related to humanity and the restoration of the pure identity of man, one which was free from misconceptions and socially established variances. Renan discredits the theory that race is the basis for the unification of people. It is important to note that France was quite ethnically diverse during the French Revolution and the rule of Napoleon, but it nevertheless managed to set the stage for nationalism. Renan also asserts that neither language nor religion are basis for solidarity because language \"invites people to unite, but does not force them to do so\" and \"religion has become an individual matter.\" For example, the United States and the United Kingdom both speak English but do not constitute a single, united nation and countries no longer operate on the notion of religions operating against each other, forcing people to choose between one or the other.\n",
      "Renan believed that a unique element of the European nation-forming experience was the mixture of races, origins and religions, where conquering people often adopted the religion and manners, and married the women, of the people they conquered. For example, \"at the end of one or two generations, the Norman invaders were indistinguishable from the rest of the population\". Nonetheless, they had a profound influence, bringing with them \"a nobility of military habit, a patriotism\" which did not exist in England before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Forgetfulness ==\n",
      "Renan then states what has become one of the most famous and enduring ideas of the essay: \"Forgetfulness, and I would even say historical error, are essential in the creation of a nation.\"  Historical research, by revealing unwanted truths, can even endanger nationhood. All nations, even the most benevolent in later practice,  are founded on acts of violence, which are then forgotten. \"Unity is always achieved by brutality: the joining of the north of France with the south was the result of nearly a century of extermination and terror\". He believes that people unite in their memories of suffering because alleviating grief requires a \"common effort\" which serves as a foundation for unity. Members of a community feel as though they have accomplished something great when they are able to survive in adverse conditions. He gives some examples of countries like Turkey and Bohemia where there is rigid stratification, or where different communities are played off against one another, and where the homogenization of different groups could not take place, resulting in a failure of nationhood. This leads to one of the most frequently quoted statements in the essay:\n",
